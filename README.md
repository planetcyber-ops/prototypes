HTML & CSS FOUNDATIONS

HTML & CSS: Essentials
Learn the core building blocks: HTML elements, attributes, and how CSS hooks onto them to control presentation.

HTML element anatomy
Every element has an opening tag, optional content, and a closing tag.

The browser reads this tree (called the DOM) to render the page.

Example
index.html
<p class="lead" title="Intro">Hello world</p>
Tag name: p defines a paragraph.
Attributes: class and title supply metadata.
Content: Inner text that users see.
If you want to read more or get an in-depth understanding, see HTML Elements and HTML Attributes in the HTML tutorial.

Global attributes you will use everywhere
class - groups elements for CSS styling.
id - unique identifier for one element (useful for anchors and scripting).
title - tooltip text.
lang - language of a document or element (<html lang="en">).
data-* - custom data attributes for scripts or styling hooks.
Reference: HTML Global Attributes.

How CSS attaches to HTML
Use selectors based on tag, class, or id to style the markup.

Inline styles work, but external stylesheets keep projects maintainable.

Note: Selectors are words that tell CSS which HTML element to style, for example .card for any element with class="card".

HTML + CSS
index.htmlstyles.css
<article class="card" id="intro">
  <h2>Welcome</h2>
  <p>Learning HTML and CSS together unlocks creative freedom.</p>
</article>

Semantic structure matters
Prefer semantic tags (<header>, <nav>, <main>, <section>, <footer>) over generic <div>s.

They help screen readers and search engines understand the page.

Check HTML Semantics for full definitions.

Block vs inline
Block elements (e.g., <div>, <section>, <p>) span full width and start on a new line.
Inline elements (e.g., <span>, <a>, <strong>) only take necessary width.
This distinction affects layout and is crucial when applying CSS display rules.

Whitespace and indentation
Indent child elements consistently to visualize hierarchy.

Browsers ignore extra whitespace, but it makes code easier to read for us humans.

<main>
  <section>
    <h2>Headline</h2>
    <p>Supporting text.</p>
  </section>
</main>
